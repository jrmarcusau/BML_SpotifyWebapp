To run:
- Download all folders and files (in the same structures) into your own working folder, and open in VSCode or other editor
- [alternately] clone current repo into working git environemnt
- navigate to the backend folder (C:/user/.../BML_SpotifyWebapp/backend/)
- run (don't type the arrow):
-   $> node server.js
-   site will be at http://localhost:3000/ (can change port in server.js)

Possible Problems:
- missing packages: follow error instructions and download missing packages
- permission to use Spotify denied: slack Marcus or email mjau@usc.edu with problem and the email you're trying to login from
- general input bugs: kill and restart, then notify Marcus (the bug button is fake, unfortunately)
-   $> [ctrl c]
-   $> node server.js
